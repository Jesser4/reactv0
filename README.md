# Learning React

This project was created from npm init react-app to create a template

I have no clue where I will take this I'm just learning as I go

This site will end at a simple back and front end inventory system. You can filter the data and add/delete items to it.

## How to run:
Open two terminals and change directory (cd) to the project file.

run on the first terminal <json-server -p 3000 db.json>

run on the second terminal <npm start --port 3001>

open http://localhost:3001/ and http://localhost:3000/items in browser
